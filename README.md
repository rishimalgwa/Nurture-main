# Nurture
Nurture is a website built to spread awareness about the importance of proper nutrition, to end hunger and achieve food security, thereby also promoting sustainable agriculture. The website also accepts donations from people willing to help, so that the money may be used to support agriculture and NGOs which aim to provide 'food for all'.
